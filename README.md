# InkwellPlusPlus
A C++ API for the Inkwell project.

# State of the API
I am still working on it. Currently, it can do the following:
- Deserialize and Serialize an Inkwell JSON
- Utilize Facts, Events and Rules, stored in a Table, which itself is present within a Project
- Access, read and modify entries
- Trigger entries and dispatch callbacks

# Future plans
- Add custom entries
- Clean up code
